    Your group name, your full names, CPP email, and GitHub usernames
    Each member’s roles and contributions in completing the project.
    Whether you have implemented extra features (eg. unit test class using some framework)
    A link to your screencast on some video streaming website. The screen cast should introduce your names and demo run your code, and each person should talk about their code briefly. Please make it shorter than 3 minutes. (Hint: you can edit the video – concatenate/delete video sections.)
